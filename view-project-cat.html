                <p> I cannot wait for the future when we have our kids and our little 
                    family. We will do all the awesome things we have always dreamed 
                    of doing in our lives. I donâ€™t know what good deeds I have done to 
                    deserve your neverending love, but I am grateful that you came my way. 
                    When anyone tries to hit on me or flirt with me, I tell them that I am 
                    in the most loving relationship ever with an amazing boyfriend whom I 
                    love beyond everything in this world.
                </p>

                    You have loved me in good and in difficult times. You have been my 
                    pillar of strength. You stayed by me through my flaws and down moments, 
                    and you never judged me when I was at my worst. Instead, you embraced 
                    me into your loving arms just the way I was and showered me with care 
                    so pure and unconditional that it made me cry. Your love is definitely 
                    deeper than the ocean, and I cannot wait to spend my life with you. My 
                    once sorrowful heart is now overwhelmed with joy from the moment you 
                    walked into my world and changed it for good. I love you, my love!
