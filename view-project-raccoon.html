                <p>You have loved me in good and in difficult times. You have been my

                    me into your loving arms just the way I was and showered me with care 
                    so pure and unconditional that it made me cry. Your love is definitely 
                    deeper than the ocean, and I cannot wait to spend my life with you. My

                    walked into my world and changed it for good. I love you, my love!
